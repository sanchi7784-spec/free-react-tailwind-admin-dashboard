2. **Connect to API** - Integrate with backend API for CRUD operations
3. **Add State Management** - Consider using Redux or Context API for global state
4. **Form Validation** - Add more robust validation (e.g., using Formik or React Hook Form)
5. **Dynamic Data** - Replace sample data with actual API calls
6. **Role Management** - Add dynamic role fetching from the system
7. **Branch Management** - Add dynamic branch fetching from the system
